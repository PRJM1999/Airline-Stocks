        "text" : "Ryanair is an Irish low-cost airline founded in 1984. It has since grown to become one of Europe's leading airlines, profiting from deregulations of the European air industry in the 1990s. Ryanair's growth is reflected in its increase in passenger numbers and generated revenue. In 2020/21, the company had uplifted 27.5 million people and connected 216 destinations.\n\n One of the key factors that contributed to Ryanair's growth was its adoption of the low-cost airline model pioneered by Southwest Airlines in the United States. Ryanair implemented many of Southwest's cost-cutting measures, such as flying to secondary airports, using a single type of aircraft to reduce maintenance costs, and offering no-frills service.\n\nRyanair also developed its own unique methods for keeping costs low. For example, it charges passengers for many services that other airlines offer for free, such as checked baggage and seat selection. It also saves money by not providing complimentary food or drinks on its flights.\n\nRyanair's growth is expected to continue in the coming years. The company has raised its 5-year growth forecast from 33% to 50%, with pre-Covid traffic of 149 million expected to grow to over 225 million guests by March 2026."

        "text" : "American Airlines is one of the oldest and largest airlines in the United States, founded in 1930. The airline grew rapidly over the decades and became one of the dominant players in the industry. In the 1990s, American Airlines was facing financial challenges and turned to a series of mergers and acquisitions as a strategy to remain competitive. The airline merged with Trans World Airlines (TWA) in 2001, followed by US Airways in 2013, to become one of the largest airlines in the world.\n\nThe merger with TWA gave American Airlines access to TWA's European routes and helped the airline establish a stronger presence in international markets. The merger with US Airways was aimed at expanding American Airlines' domestic market share and consolidating the airline industry in the United States. The merger also helped American Airlines gain more bargaining power with suppliers and control over pricing, leading to increased profitability.\n\nHowever, the airline industry is highly competitive and faces numerous challenges such as rising fuel costs, labor disputes, and changing consumer preferences. American Airlines has faced financial challenges in recent years, including losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The airline has been forced to cut costs, reduce its workforce, and seek government aid to stay afloat.\n\nLooking forward, American Airlines' financial future will depend on the airline's ability to adapt to changing market conditions and maintain its competitive position. The airline will need to continue investing in technology, improving customer experience, and expanding its route network to remain competitive. American Airlines' strong brand recognition, global presence, and strategic partnerships with other airlines are assets that can help the airline navigate the challenging landscape of the airline industry."
